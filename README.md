# Build an ingestion application for IBM Cloud Object Storage and deploy on Kubernetes

## Overview


## Prerequisites


## Flow


## Included Components


## Steps

### 1.Create IBM Cloud services and configure
#### 1.	Create COS instance and obtain  S3 Credentials
We need to create an instance of the cloud object storage service , once the provisioning process completes, you will be returned back to the main ObjectStorage portal page and should see the newly created S3 compatible version of Object Storage as follows.
Set up your storage
First things first, you need to have buckets to store data in.

#### 2.	Creating an instance of sqlcloudfunction

### Run the application
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
To run the server, run:
```
npm start
```
To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```
This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
